Web scraping using jSoup and Coldfusion

jsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient API for fetching URLs and extracting and manipulating data, using the best of HTML5 DOM methods and CSS selectors.

jsoup implements the WHATWG HTML5 specification, and parses HTML to the same DOM as modern browsers do.

1. scrape and parse HTML from a URL, file, or string
2. find and extract data, using DOM traversal or CSS selectors
3. manipulate the HTML elements, attributes, and text
4. clean user-submitted content against a safelist, to prevent XSS attacks
5. output tidy HTML
6. jsoup is designed to deal with all varieties of HTML found in the wild; from pristine and validating, to invalid tag-soup; jsoup will create a sensible parse tree.
